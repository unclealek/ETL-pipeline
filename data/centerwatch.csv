"","Mosunetuzumab for Early Relapse of Follicular Lymphoma in the Nordic Countries","https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/NCT05849857/mosunetuzumab-for-early-relapse-of-follicular-lymphoma-in-the-nordic-countries?location=finland&sortBy=distance&lat=60.17116&long=24.93265","2","Helsinki","Background: Standard first line treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma and
      symptomatic disease is immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The most commonly used
      treatment regimens are rituximab plus bendamustin or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
      vincristine and prednisolone), rituximab plus lenalidomide or rituximab monotherapy. The
      long-term outcome is similar for these regimens; 75-80% of patients are alive 10 years after
      initial treatment. A subgroup of 20-40% of patients does not respond to or relapse within 24
      months of initial treatment (abbreviated POD24 for ""progression of disease within 24 months),
      and they risk poorer effect of second line treatments and shorter survival. Only 30-70% of
      these patients are alive 5 years after initial treatment, depending on the type of first line
      treatment, and they are in need of improved treatment options. Mosunetuzumab is a new,
      bispecific, T-cell engaging antibody that has shown very high response rates and long
      response duration in B-cell lymphoma patients with multiple relapses or lack of response to
      standard salvage regimens. It is therefore possible that mosunetuzumab will benefit patients
      with POD24. The main hypothesis of this trial is that mosunetuzumab is better than standard
      2nd line salvage regimens in terms of progression free survival 2 years after the initiation
      of 2nd line treatment in POD24 patients.

      Objectives: The main objective is to investigate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC)
      mosunetuzumab monotherapy in follicular lymphoma (FL) with POD24.

      The secondary objectives are to investigate

        -  safety of mosunetuzumab in patients with a current POD24 event

        -  prognostic significance of 18F-FDG-PET-CT response to mosunetuzumab

        -  rate of transformation to higher grade lymphoma following mosunetuzumab

        -  patients´ self-reported quality of life during and after mosunetuzumab

        -  resource usage related to mosunetuzumab

      Interventions: Mosunetuzumab is administered SC as described below. Patients are followed for
      at least 2,5 years and a maximum of 5 years in the trial. Study-specific sampling of
      peripheral blood for exploratory research amounts to 330-380 mL (depending on the number of
      treatment cycles) collected over 3 years. Study-specific tumor samples for future research
      will be collected by fine needle aspiration before the start of treatment and after the third
      treatment cycle.

      Ethical considerations: Previous studies have shown that mosunetuzumab is highly effective
      and well tolerated in heavily treated B-cell lymphoma patients. The safety profile is
      favourable compared to standard immunochemotherapy. Mosunetuzumab can be safely administered
      to older patients with co-morbidities, and there is no upper age limit for participation in
      the trial. The potential beneficial effect of mosunetuzumab in a population of follicular
      lymphoma patients with POD24 outweighs the risk for rare and undiscovered serious adverse
      events. The total volume of blood samples is considered acceptable for patients in clinical
      trials. The extra tumor samples for research purposes will only be collected if deemed safe
      and not to cause unreasonable discomfort for the participating subject. The extra number of
      CT scans is 2-3 compared to standard practice and represents a minimal increase in radiation
      exposure. In total, the benefit to risk balance is deemed positive for this trial.","260 weeks","Oslo University Hospital"
"","Exogenous and Endogenous Risk Factors for Early-onset Colorectal Cancer","https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/NCT05732623/exogenous-and-endogenous-risk-factors-for-early-onset-colorectal-cancer?location=finland&sortBy=distance&lat=60.17116&long=24.93265","N/A","Helsinki","Background Firstly described in U.S. series, an increase in early-onset colorectal cancers
      (eoCRC), defined as CRC before 50 years, is confirmed globally.

      CRC pathogenesis has been associated with several endogenous and exogenous associated risk
      factors, including family history of CRC, CRC-related germline pathogenic variants, obesity,
      alcohol habits, physical activity, red and processed meat and a Western diet. Two dietary
      patterns appear as exogenous and behavioral factors associated with either CRC prevention or
      predisposition: the 'healthy' pattern (high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains or
      legumes, fish, and low-fat milk or dairy products) and the 'unhealthy' or 'Western dietary'
      pattern (high in red and processed meat, sugary drinks, refined grains, desserts). Above all,
      the Western diet is one of the most important CRC risk factors. In the Nurses' Health Study
      II, Western diet during adolescence was associated with the development of high-risk rectal
      adenomas later in life. In a meta-analysis of cohort studies, the Western dietary pattern
      conferred a relative risk (RR) of 1.12 for CRC, compared with a 0.89 RR for the healthy
      pattern. Conversely, the Mediterranean diet demonstrated a protective role in CRC
      development, confirmed in the EPIC cohort study.

      Rationale Dietary, lifestyle, and anthropometric risk factors are still poorly understood in
      eoCRC patients, despite its established rising incidence. To date, scant studies, mostly
      case-control and only a few prospective ones, investigated the exogenous risk factors of
      eoCRCs and eoCRC precursors and identified high intake of alcohol and processed meat,
      sedentary lifestyle as potential eoCRC risk factors, and obesity as ambiguous one.

      Primary Objective To compare the associations of specific dietary and lifestyle factors
      (smoking habit, alcohol intake, physical activity) and anthropometric factors between eoCRC
      patients and healthy age- and sex-matched controls in countries with increasing versus stable
      or decreasing early-onset colorectal cancer (eoCRC) incidence.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To validate the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ);

        2. To evaluate the consistency of associations across cohorts in pairwise comparisons;

        3. To assess whether associations differ among specific population subgroups (e.g., sex,
           ethnicity, smoking habits, BMI, physical activity, family history of CRC).

      Type of study SQFFQ validation study: three non-consecutive 24-hour Dietary Recalls (24hDRs)
      will validate the ad hoc designed and shared SQFFQ, as previously performed [28-29]. The
      SQFFQ will be administered to the validation study group during three non-consecutive calls,
      including one non-weekday (30 minutes 24-h-recall computer-aided personal interview).

      Case-control study: an international, multicentre, retrospective case-control study of
      prospectively enrolled patients will be performed to evaluate the associations of dietary,
      anthropometric, lifestyle factors in eoCRC patients compared to age, and sex matched healthy
      controls.

      This study is sub-classified as a low-risk intervention study as it will perform fecal occult
      blood test as an additional procedure in the control group.

      Inclusion criteria All sexes eligible Cases: eoCRC diagnosed between 18 and 49 years and
      confirmed by histology (biopsy or surgical specimen in case of surgery) Controls: negative
      past and present history of cancer; negative fecal occult blood test (FOBT), or negative
      colonoscopy.

      Exclusion criteria CRC diagnosed at ≥ 50 years Diseases that can modify the dietary regimen
      (celiac disease, diabetes) Diseases that are known to predispose to eoCRC (personal past or
      recent history of inflammatory bowel disease, past history of pelvic irradiation) Unable to
      give written consents and to fill in the electronic questionnaire

      Sample size

      SQFFQ Validation study:

      - 100 subjects from each country, free from overt disease and in equal numbers of each
      gender.

      Case-control study:

        -  At least 300 eoCRC patients in total;

        -  At least 600 healthy age- (matching range ± 5 years) and sex-matched controls subjects
           in total.

      Study Procedure and Study Flow-chart Starting from the signature of the informed consent by
      the subject/patient (or subject/patient's legal tutor), she/he will be considered enrolled in
      the study.

      The PI will be the only Administrator of the online platform and the only one able to
      generate the access codes (username/password) assigned to the co-investigators.

      Each co-investigator will register the enrolled subjects anonymously on the online platform
      (unique alphanumeric identification code - see below), obtaining a username/password assigned
      to the subject for survey completion.

      The unique alphanumeric identification code (Subject ID number) will be assigned
      consecutively in increasing order starting from '001'. A screened subject/patient
      identification list will be kept by PI.

      SQFFQ validation study:

      One hundred volunteers from each country, free from overt disease and in equal numbers of
      each sex, will be enrolled for the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ)
      validation study. Potential volunteers will be recruited through different recruitment
      strategies: mail drops, recruitment lists, and databases, primary care facilities as well as
      networks for young people and/or among people who work in the same hospital of the research
      team, regularly followed by preventive medicine.

      An ad hoc-designed and shared online SQFFQ will be available to report the usual frequency of
      consumption of a detailed list of foods and beverages. Information collected concern types,
      amount and frequency of consumption of food and drinks, types of seasoning, and methods of
      cooking. The computer-administered instrument will allow the respondent to select the food
      consumed and the appropriate portion size from photographs on a screen reducing the burden of
      coding.

      All volunteers will receive detailed oral and written information by members of the study
      team (following local practices).

      Three non-consecutive 24-hour Dietary Recalls (24hDRs), including one non-weekday (30 minutes
      24-h-recall computer-aided personal interview), will validate the SQFFQ [28-29].

      Case-control study:

      An international, multicentre, retrospective case-control study of prospectively enrolled
      patients will be performed to evaluate the associations of dietary, anthropometric, lifestyle
      factors in eoCRC patients compared to age, and sex matched healthy controls.

      This study is sub-classified as a low-risk intervention study as it will perform fecal occult
      blood test as an additional procedure in the control group.

      The study will recruit:

        -  at least 300 patients in total (100 at IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute) with a
           recent diagnosis of eoCRC (diagnosis made within 2 years prior to enrollment), aged
           18-49 years, will be prospectively recruited. eoCRC patients will be primarily enrolled
           as referred by the participant unit. Each participant unit shall identify eoCRC patients
           through recruitment lists and databases, primary care facilities, as well as networks
           for young people. Retrospective data (dietary and lifestyle factors) related to the 2
           years prior to eoCRC diagnosis will be collected through an online platform.

        -  at least 600 Healthy controls (HCs) totally (200 at IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific
           Institute), matched by age (matching range ± 5 years) and sex with eoCRCs will be
           prospectively enrolled. Healthy volunteers will be mainly enrolled among workers within
           the participating hospital center, followed regularly by preventive medicine. This
           enrollment will be carried out by e-mail invitation disseminated through the hospital's
           official mailing list. The enrolled healthy volunteers will perform fecal occult blood
           test as an additional procedure and will be enrolled if this test is negative.
           Retrospective data (dietary and lifestyle factors) related to the 2 years prior to
           recruitment will be collected through an online platform.

      The online platform will be divided into two separate sections: (i) one completed by cases /
      controls, concerning the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ), lifestyle
      habits and anthropometric data; (ii) one completed by doctors, concerning clinical data.

      The semi-quantitative food frequency approach will ask to report their usual frequency of
      consumption of each food and drink, referred to the two years before eoCRC onset, following
      detailed oral and written instructions from the members of the study team. Information
      collected will concern types, amount and frequency of consumption of food and drinks, types
      of seasoning, and methods of cooking. A computer-administered instrument will allow the
      respondent to select the food consumed and the appropriate portion size from photographs on a
      screen reducing the burden of coding.

      All cases and healthy controls will also provide a set of covariates as part of the online
      platform: date of birth, sex, ethnicity, weight (kg)/height (m)/BMI (kg/m2) at the time of
      eoCRC diagnosis and at 18 years old, country where the patient/healthy control lives
      permanently, tobacco smoking at the time of eoCRC diagnosis and at 18 years old, sitting
      time, TV-viewing time, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), waist circumference
      (cm), home blood pressure levels (mmHg), fasting blood glucose (mg/dl), regular consumption
      of aspirin/NSAID, calcium and folate supplements, oral contraceptive agents, post-menopausal
      hormones and years of consumptions, if the filled questionnaire reflects diet for the last
      5-10 years before.

      Other clinical data will be collected by doctors as part of the online platform: date of
      eoCRC diagnosis, symptoms at diagnosis, eoCRC localization, eoCRC stage, histological
      diagnosis, type of surgery and date (if performed), chemoterapy and radiotherapy (if
      performed), vital status and duration of follow-up, family history of CRC and other cancers
      (uterus, ovary, stomach, small intestine, urinary tract/bladder/kidney, bile ducts, brain,
      pancreas, skin tumors), type of germline pathogenetic variant (if performed).

      4.6 Responsibilities of the Investigator(s) The Investigator(s) undertake(s) to perform the
      study in accordance with this Protocol, Good Clinical Practice and the applicable regulatory
      requirements.

      The Investigator is required to ensure compliance with the investigational schedule, and
      procedures required by the protocol.

      The Investigator agrees to provide all information requested in the Case Report Form -CRF- in
      an accurate and legible manner.

      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethical conduct of the study The study will be performed according the
      ethical principles laid down in the latest accepted version of the Declaration of Helsinki.

      Patient information and informed consent Each subject/patient will be informed about the
      modalities of the clinical study in accordance with the enclosed patient information. The
      subject/patient is to be informed both in writing and verbally by the investigating
      physician. The subject/patient must be given opportunity to decide whether or not to
      participate in this study and to ask questions concerning this. It must also be made clear to
      the subject/patient that he/she can withdraw from the study at any time without giving
      reasons and that he/she will not be in any way disadvantaged by this. The points mentioned in
      the information sheet must be communicated to the patient in language he/she understands. The
      informing physician and the patient must each personally date and sign an informed consent
      form with a declaration on data privacy. Any informed consent will be part of the
      investigator's file and retained with it. The subject/patient will retain a copy of the
      patient information.

      Data management The personal data will be recorded in the electronic CRF designed for this
      study. All CRF will be checked for completeness, plausibility, and compliance with the ICH
      guidelines and the institutional Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

      The personal data will be identified with a code (see section 6.7) not allowing directly
      trace the identity of the patients/individuals, except in case of need. In all phases of
      collection and processing of personal data, suitable measures will be adopted to guarantee
      their protection from the risks of unauthorized access, theft or loss, also through the use
      of encryption techniques, identification codes or other solutions that allow identify the
      interested parties only in case of need and to those who are expressly authorized to access
      them, in order to minimize the risks of accidental knowledge and unauthorized or abusive
      access to data. The genetic and clinical data of the interested parties are, however, treated
      separately from other ""common"" personal data (name, surname, etc.), which allow the
      interested parties to be directly identified.

      The collection, management and analysis of data will take place in a way that guarantees the
      confidentiality of the subject's identity and will follow the General Data Protection
      Regulations (GDPR).

      With regard to the possible transfer of data to third countries, the processing will take
      place according to one of the methods permitted by current law, such as the consent given by
      the patients/individuals, the adoption of Standard Clauses approved by the European
      Commission, the selection of subjects adhering to international programs for the free
      circulation of data (eg EU-USA Privacy Shield) or operating in countries considered safe by
      the European Commission.

      All analyses will be performed within respective limitations of each ethics committee
      approval and in accordance with good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.

      Sample size

      SQFFQ Validation study:

      100 subjects from each country, free from overt disease and in equal numbers of each gender.

      Case-control study:

      Power analysis for odds ratios calculation The odds ratios of eoCRC for different exposition
      factors will be calculated.

      For this purpose, a power analysis is performed, based on the following parameters:

        -  Significance level (alpha, 1 type error probability) = 0.05 (two tails test)

        -  Power of the analysis = 80%

        -  Number of controls per case = 2

        -  Minimum Odds Ratio to detect = 2

        -  Proportion of exposed in the general population The proportion of exposed individuals in
           the general population depends on the considered exposition factors (such as a specific
           diet habit, alcohol consumption, etc.): for this reason, the sample size was calculated
           for different exposition proportions, varying from 5% to 95%.

      Statistical analysis

      SQFFQ validation Study:

      The validity of the SQFFQ will be computed by calculating the Spearman correlation
      coefficients between individual food groups intakes from SQFFQ and the average of three 24hDR
      food groups intakes as the reference method.

      The percentage of the agreement as the proportions of individuals who were classified
      correctly into the same or adjacent quintile for validity analyses will be calculated.

      Case-control Study:

      In the case-control study, an association between eoCRC and dietary habits (or other
      exposition factors such as alcohol consumption, smoking habits, etc.) will be estimated using
      logistic regression and odds ratio calculation. Multivariate logistic regression models will
      be used to examine to what extent eoCRC development can be 'explained' by variations in
      eating habits. The stratified analysis will also be performed by considering only a specific
      gender and/or other grouping variables of interest such as age, age at diagnosis. The effects
      of potential confounders other than matching criteria (e.g., smoking, physical activity,
      etc.) will also be estimated and taken into account. All analyses are based on a conservative
      estimate of eoCRC cancer cases, with at least 2 controls per case.","635 weeks","San Raffaele University"
